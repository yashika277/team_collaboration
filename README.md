## Features
- *User Authentication*: Secure login and registration with JWT.
- *Role Management*: Admin and User roles with specific permissions.
- *Task Management*: Create, read, update, delete, and filter tasks.
- *Real-time Chat*: Integrated chat functionality using Socket.IO for project-specific communication.
- *API Documentation*: Comprehensive API documentation with sample requests and responses.

## Requirements
1. *Authentication & Role-Based Access*
   - Implement JWT for secure user authentication.
   - Set up roles for Admin and User, with corresponding permissions.
   
2. *API Development*
   - Build endpoints for:
     - User registration, login, and role assignment.
     - Task management: create, update, delete, and filter tasks by different criteria.
     - Real-time chat with Socket.IO integration for project-specific chat rooms.

3. *Database Setup*
   - Use MongoDB to store users, tasks, and chat messages.
   - Create models for each data type with appropriate schema and relationships.

4. *Security & Middleware*
   - Apply authentication middleware for protected routes.
   - Use basic security practices like Helmet and CORS.

5. *API Documentation*
   - Document all endpoints using Postman with sample requests and responses.



## Technologies Used
- *Node.js*: Backend runtime environment.
- *Express.js*: Web framework for building APIs.
- *MongoDB*: NoSQL database for data storage.
- *Mongoose*: ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- *Socket.IO*: Real-time communication library.
- *JWT (JSON Web Tokens)*: For authentication.
- *Postman*: For API testing and documentation.
- *Helmet*: Security middleware for HTTP headers.
- *CORS*: Middleware for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
